# Brain Tumor Detection
Machine Learning Project CS 6140 Spring 2022

The objective of this project is to explore various supervised machine learning techniques to
classify brain tumors from MRI images of brain scans. Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support
vector machine and various Neural Network models (Convolutional Neural Network, and Mo-
bileNet). will be leveraged to classify the types of tumors from MRI images. The trained models
will then be tested on unseen MRI images to evaluate which model(s) are more suited for the
classification of brain tumors which will be followed by a comparative analysis of the models.
